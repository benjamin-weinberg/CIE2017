// Created by Johnson, Hans J on 4/20/17.
//
// The mall game class provides the state and behaviors necessary
// for implementing a game.  In this game, characters are travel through
// the mall making purchases, and loosing purchases.
//
// The mall game is organized as a loop of stores, and as each
// character moves from store to store during their turn, they
// can make purchases or loose purchases from their purchase list.
//
// The characters continue playing until they are experience one of the
// following situations:
//      1) Die from hunger (cumulative food health status < 0 )
//      2) Die from boredom (cumulative entertainment health status < 0)
//      3) Die from embarrassment (cumulative clothes health status < 0)
//
// The rules for the game are as follows:
//    a) A character rolls a 6 sided dice to start their turn
//               The player moves forward the number of stores shown on the dice
//    b) A character rolls the dice again
//          If it is an odd number
//               must remove that many items from their purchase list
//          If it is an even number
//             The character must make a single purchase from
//    b) The character must update and display their current cummulative health status to the screen.
//         If any of the situations listed above (die, or goto jail), then that player is removed from the game.
//    c) If there is only 1 player left, that player is the winner of the game, and the game terminates.
